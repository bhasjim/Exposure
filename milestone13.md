Took in TA suggestion to make top header smaller and got rid of redundant features. Also cleaned up useless sections of the page. I also changed the way the map looks to make our markers stand out more.

Implemented functionality to the nearby pictures that allows the users to view them as the main picture as suggested by peers. Also added the titles of the pictures onto the modal.

Finally got around to adding a user interface for adding and removing tags that will be used in the future to filter pictures.

Created a new homepage that keeps the map front and center. Began implementing the back end to filter photos based on tags and limit pictures to an inputted amount. Adjusted the marker clusterer settings.
