# Bahari Hasjim
I implemented the feature to search for pictures by descriptors (aka Tag feature). Now, users can search for "dogs" or "tacos" in the top left corner. This makes this app a lot more dynamic and user friendly because users can find what they want easily :) Also picked colors for the UI.

# Justine Lin
Made some final UI changes. Polished up some of the code as well.

# Julian Joshua Komala
Fixed some small bugs such as page not scrolling up after clicking picture on a nearby picture. I limited the size of the main picture so that it wouldnt extend the pop up. Also implemented the tag search feature to nearby pictures. 

# David Moll
Fixed clustering so that when you click a cluster you see a gallery of photos rather than zooming in. Helped Bahari with the tag feature. Fixed vertical scaling.
