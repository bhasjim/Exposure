  We've all experienced being stuck trying to find a place to go or something to do. Our app, Exposure, gives people a source of inspiration that will motivate them to go out and explore the world around them. Whether it is to sightsee, find a new hiking trail, or take pictures, our app does it all.
  
Currently, the only way to find interesting spots around you are Yelp or Tripadvisor, and both do not really have an instant way to view photos. There is also Instagram, but like the other two, it does not have a map view to instantly view the photos and where these photos were taken. As a result, there is no real leading application that allows users to view photos based on the photo's location.

  Our approach attempts to utilize this generation's addiction to social media and photo sharing. We take advantage of this by displaying the hottest spots to take photos. We think this will be successful because bloggers, photographers, and anyone into beautifying their social media would be interested in using this application. This is a one-way ticket to a popular picture.
  
  This app will make it easier then ever to see places in the most beautiful way possible. Using google image search, it is possible to get pictures of almost anything, but the quality of said photos is usually subpar, and sifting through them is a task left to the user. Flickr is a website which is self curated - the highest rated pictures rise to the top. This map based way to interact with great photos will lead to higher satisfaction and the injection of beauty into our daily lives.
