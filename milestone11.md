I implemented the whole website framework. I made sure our website was working properly with the navbars, homepage, and the background images. I also changed the symbol we used to represent pictures on the map.

I embedded the map that used to be on a separate page into the main page in the "Map" section.  I also formatted the main cover page to have the sections we needed.

This week I worked on finishing up the map part of our app. I implemented marker clustering, which makes meta markers when there are too many markers in one place. I also added a search box for the map so users could jump to any location in Googleâ€™s places. I also made some slight UI adjustments around the map.

We moved away from the bottom slide up when we transitioned the map to being embedded on the home screen. I worked on implementing an overlay popup that shows the picture of the marker the user clicks on. I also added a basic gallery of nearby pictures based on the longitude and latitude of the marker.
