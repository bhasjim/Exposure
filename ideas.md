    3. Workout Tracking App
        - Track running trail and number of miles
    4. Surfing App
        - Popular surfing locations and high tides.
    5. Data Visualization
        - General Health visualization (Obesity Rates)
        - Diseases
    6. Clothing Stores Sales
        - Show stores that currently have sales
    7. Study Spots Off-Campus
        - Popular study spots off-campus
    8. Map with albums attached to location pins
        - Instagram, but with location, not friends, being how pictures are grouped
        - Highest ranked pictures would rise to the top, like with reddit
    9. Most popular places to take instagram pictures. 
        - Scrape Instagram/Facebook for locations of pictures
        - Have bubbles on map with numbers for the amount of pictures taken there
        - As you zoom in, bubbles split to represent more specific places
