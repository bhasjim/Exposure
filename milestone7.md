We have made a lot of progress since last week. We now have different markers to signify that a location is popular. We also have a tab/pop up when you click on markers, which is important to our functionality because we want users to be able to click on markers and then look at the photos from that location. Also, we finally accessed Flickr API and are successfully pulling photos from it, so we can start viewing photos and putting it on the map according to its Geolocation

Figured out geoLocation for pictures so they can be correctly located on map. (If the picture has a geolocation attribute)
